## Exercises is from _EJS_

Recently, I'm reading [_Eloquent JavaScript_](http://eloquentjavascript.net/index.html), the JS-beginner-friendly book. After reading each chapter, I will try to solute the corresponding exercises to examine myself.

So all the exercises are from _EJS_.

 

P.S. For short, I would always like to call it **_EJS_** here as well as in codes' comments.
