# EJS-solutions

### Exercises is from _EJS_

Recently, I'm reading [_Eloquent JavaScript_](http://eloquentjavascript.net/index.html), the JS-beginner-friendly book. After reading each chapter, I have tried to solute the corresponding exercises as to examine myself.

So all the exercises are from _EJS_ without doubt, and can be found in the link above at the end of each chapter.

P.S. For short, I would always like to call it **_EJS_** here as well as in codes' comments.

### Solutions is from baishusama and _EJS_

For each exercise, I will first attempt to give my own solution, and then try to figure it out according to the hint. Finally, I would look at the given solution on [_EJS_'s online code sandbox](http://eloquentjavascript.net/code/).

### Read which _EJS_ ?

I think the online version is the best way of reading _EJS_. As the codes among the pasages are all in webpages' editer, which can run code to see the output. That's extremely nice, especially in chapter 9 - the animateWorld function is amazingly fun!

But taking good-good-study into account, even with the e-book, having a printed one at hand is always a plus :P
